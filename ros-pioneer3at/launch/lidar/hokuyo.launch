  <!-- Note: This launch file is not set up for 2D mapping!
             I am using the SICK lms for mapping, and this hokuyo for
             making a 3D point cloud by pointing it upwards yeilding a 
             3D pointcloud of the enviornment.
             
             To use this for mapping, you will need ot change the static
             transform below to match your mounting postition and change
             /Hokuyo/most_intense to /Pioneer3AT/laserscan  -->
